# 2D-Running-Game

## Intro
This is my first game developed on brouser.

## Working
A sprite image of character os used along with the moving loop of background. The obstacle comes from right to left and 4 obstacle images are used which are places randomly on same div. Once the obstacle is touched, game over and your score is displayed. The score is counted on top right corner giving 1 point for every 10ms alive. A play/pause button is provided in the top middle section for convinience.
